- 🔭 I am a Computer Science graduate student from Western Illinois University. Currently working as a Teaching Assistant in my university. Solely, teaching the two batches of the     Computer Literacy course (which includes MS office applications, Databases, Networking, and Other computer concepts) to students. 
- 🌱 Having a strong willingness to learn new things, especially related to Machine / Deep Learning technology, and Software development. Also, I’m always ready to complete given work with accuracy and quality. I believe, I may not be the most knowledgeable and killed person, but I am confident that I would be the most hard working person your organization can have.
